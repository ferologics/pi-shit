# Extensions TODO Index

Use this file as an index (and for truly shared extension-platform chores).

## Extension backlogs

- Plan mode: `plan-mode/TODO.md`
- Deep review: `deep-review/TODO.md`

## Ownership rules

- Put extension-specific TODOs next to the extension folder.
- Keep this file short and pointer-oriented.
- Keep upstream source-of-truth aligned in `~/dev/pi-extensions` when working there.
